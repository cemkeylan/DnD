# Dungeons and Dragons

A repo for my DnD game. Everything I share in the game, I upload to this repo (And I also have a private repo on my Raspberry Pi in which I have the 'nextgame' branch, but they have no idea because they will never bother to read this).

Generic Stuff. Feel free to use them share them edit them, but do not use them commercially. Some of the assets I use when I create maps are licensed under [Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/)
